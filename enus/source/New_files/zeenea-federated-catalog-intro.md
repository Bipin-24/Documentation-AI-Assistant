## Introduction

The rise of the Data Mesh has revolutionized data management, emphasizing a domain-specific, decentralized model that treats data as a product. This approach ensures that data ownership, accountability, and management are handled by the teams most knowledgeable about the data. 

Zeenea Federated Catalog aligns with the core principles of Data Mesh. It supports these decentralized efforts by allowing each organizational domain to maintain its catalog with complete autonomy over its data assets.

In real terms, the Zeenea federated catalog allows you to create several sub-catalogs inside your platform and then, decentralizes stewardship and ownership responsibilities: data source crawling, curation, and documentation.

Moreover, organizations can level up this federated catalog to an Enterprise Data Marketplace (EDM). The EDM is an e-commerce-like solution, where Data Producers publish their products and Data Consumers explore, understand, and acquire these published products.

The EDM allows each domain to share its managed and valuable data products and assets with the federation without overwhelming end-users with less managed or less usable data assets.

## How it works

Zeenea offers one shared platform supporting Federated Data Catalog and EDM use cases. All metadata is managed in a single knowledge graph, that can be split between various domains by creating several sub-catalogs on the same platform. Therefore, no technical integration or data mapping is required.

Organizations can configure each connection to feed a specific catalog and manage user permissions by catalog so that each domain is responsible for curating its own assets and controls the visibility of these assets by the rest of the federation.

In the federated catalog or EDM, Zeenea Studio remains the back-office tool and Zeenea Explorer is the e-commerce-like front-end that enables end-users to search and discover in a single interface not only the whole data landscape of his domain but also the data products or assets shared by other domains in the marketplace.

Finally, Zeeneaâ€™s federated graph-powered EDM enables organizations to mirror the Data Mesh at the metadata level and build a global, scalable, supervision plane that perfectly integrates with data production and consumption processes.
