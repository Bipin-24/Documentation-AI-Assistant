# Glossary Item Hierarchy

## Hierarchical Graph of a Glossary Item

From the details page of a Glossary Item, you can view the hierarchical links of that Object in the Studio and Explorer in the form of a graphical widget.

This widget allows you to view up to 5 levels of a Glossary Object's "parent" Objects. It also allows you to view the "child" Objects which are directly linked to it.

As this widget is interactive, you can click on the name of each Item to display its details page and thus go up or down the hierarchy.

To zoom in or out, use the menu at the bottom right of the graph or use the mouse wheel while holding down the Ctrl key.
