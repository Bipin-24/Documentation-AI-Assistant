# Searching and Exploring Topics

Topics are pre-defined filtered queries that allows you to search in a subset of your catalog items. Topics are created by the catalog curators in Zeenea Studio to propose search and explore entry-points to end-users in relation with your organization context.

## Browsing the Topics List

You can access to the list of Topics that are available for your organization from Zeenea Explorer home page.

A carousel allows you to quickly browse available Topics. But you can also click the **Browse all Topics** link, at the bottom-right of the carousel, to open a dedicated page containing a table with a scrollable list of all Topics. You can use this page to search Topics by name using keywords or simply sort Topics following different criteria. Then click on a Topic name to start searching in this Topic.

## Using Topics

When selecting a Topic, you are redirected to the search page with the selected Topic activated. This allows you to explore the content of the Topic. You can then perform searches in the activated Topic: in this case, search will be restricted to the scope of the Topic. Also filters are dynamically adapted to the content of the activated Topic.

You can exit from a Topic by using the selector in the search bar and selecting the **All Items** option in the dropdown menu or by selecting another Topic.

## Managing Favorite Topics

You can also add Topics to your favorites to get a quick access to those you use the most.

From the home page, the search page or the dedicated page, click the star icon to add a Topic to your favorite Topics.

You can then access to your favorite Topics from the home page by selecting the **Favorites** filter or from the dropdown menu of the search bar.

Click again on the star icon to remove a Topic from your favorites at any time.
