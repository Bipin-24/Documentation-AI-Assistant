# Integration with Microsoft Teams

Zeenea allows you to contact Catalogue Object managers directly in their Microsoft Teams application.

Contact your Zeenea Customer Success representative in order to activate this option by specifying the list of tenants concerned, as well as the domain names (i.e., acme.com) for activating the option.

Once activated, Zeenea updates the corresponding contact profiles in the Studio and Explorer with a Teams deep link.

Click on this link to automatically initiate a conversation in Microsoft Teams with the contact concerned about an Object in the catalog.
