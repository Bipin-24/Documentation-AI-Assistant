# Installing and Configuring Connectors as a Plugin

<!-- #p100021 -->
## Introduction

<!-- #p100027 -->
Zeenea next generation connectors are now available as plugins! This new approach allows for an easier installation, as well as a speedier roll-out of new versions and features. 

<!-- #p100033 -->
## Installation Procedure

<!-- #p100039 -->
Follow these steps to install or update your plugin connector:

1. <!-- #p100045 -->
   Download the latest version of the connector through the communicated link.

2. <!-- #p100054 -->
   Stop the scanner.

3. <!-- #p100069 -->
   Move the downloaded file `connector-plugin-1.0.zip` directly in the `plugins` folder of your scanner. Do not unzip the archive.

4. <!-- #p100078 -->
   In case of an update, be sure to delete the older version of the plugin before the operation (zip file and folder).

5. <!-- #p100090 -->
   In case of installing a new connector, be sure to configure this new connector correctly as specified in its dedicated documentation. You can find a list of links to all our connection configuration documentation here: [Connector Downloads](zeenea-connectors-list.md# "title: Zeenea Connector Downloads").

6. <!-- #p100099 -->
   Restart the scanner.
