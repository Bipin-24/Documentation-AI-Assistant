# Adding and Removing Curators

A curator is in charge of documenting a specific object. They will be the main point of contact for any question related to an item’s documentation status. 

## Locating the Curators on an Object

You may add one or more curators to any type of item in the catalog. They will all be displayed in the “Curators” section, accessible through the detailed page or the overview of the selected item. 

Point your mouse over a Curator's avatar to display Its detailed information (name, responsibility, email, etc.). 

## Adding a Curator

To add a curator, click on the "+" button in the dedicated section from the item overview or details page.

You’ll then be able to select the curator(s) for this specific item directly from the list of available users.

From the Search Results, you may bulk select multiple items and add Curators to all of them at once.  

> **Note:** Curators cannot be updated through the Excel import. 

## Deleting a Curator from an Item

Use the **Delete** icon to remove Curators from an item.

## Specific Case of Fields

Dataset curators will be inherited by the Fields; those curators cannot be deleted.

However, in addition to the inherited curators, new ones can be manually added; those are managed as any other Curators, and so you’ll be able to add and/or delete them.
