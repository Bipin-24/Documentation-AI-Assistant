# Adding or Removing Item Contacts

A contact can be an individual, a team, or a legal entity which is linked to an item in the catalog. The link between this contact and the item is defined by the notion of responsibility.

Contacts do indeed play a role in the data lifecycle and therefore represent important information in the documentation for data consumers.
 
## Find the Contacts of an Item

For each item in the catalog, it is possible to add one or more contacts. 

Each new contact and associated responsibility appears in the **Contacts** section of the item, which can be viewed from their overview or detail page.

Hover your mouse over a contact avatar to display its detailed information (name, responsibility, email, etc.). 

## Add a New Contact to an Item

To add a contact to an item, click the "+" button in the **Contacts** sections from the Item overview or details page.

You can then search for a contact among those imported or created in the catalog, as well as select a responsibility from the list configured for your company.

Please note that the same contact may have several responsibilities for the same item, or different responsibilities from one item to another.
