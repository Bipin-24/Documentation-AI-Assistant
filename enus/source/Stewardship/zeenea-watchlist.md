# Creating or Deleting a Watchlist

Watchlists allow you to save your search filters in your dashboard, so you can quickly find the Items you need to process.

## Creating a Watchlist

To create a new Watchlist: 

1. Open Zeenea Studio.
2. Go to the **Catalog** section.
3. Select the desired filters.
4. Click **Save** at the top right of the screen, then click **New Watchlist**.
5. Enter the name of your Watchlist, then click **Confirm**.

To create a Watchlist, at least one Item type must be selected via the **Item** filter or via a **Scope** in the search bar.

> **Note:** Keywords entered in the search bar are ignored when creating your Watchlist.

Once created, your Watchlist is automatically added to your dashboard with the corresponding count of Items.

> **Note:** You can't have more than 10 Watchlists.

Click on the name of a Watchlist from your dashboard to apply its filters and view the corresponding list of Items.

## Deleting a Watchlist

To delete a Watchlist, go to your dashboard and click the trash can icon for your Watchlist.

You can also delete Watchlists created by default. You can recreate them later if required, using the filters at your disposal.
