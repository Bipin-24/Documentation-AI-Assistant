The following information is required to create a Topic:

* **Name**: This name will be used on the Zeenea Explorer home page to help business users
* **Description**: This is displayed for Zeenea Explorer users
* **Color**: The selected color will be applied to the Topic to give a visual cue to business users and help them find their way through the list

## Editing a Topic

Once a new Topic is created, you can still modify some of its characteristics by clicking on the pencil icon presented in front of each custom type name in the **Topics** section.

> **Note:** The filters of the Topic cannot be modified. You can only modify the name, description, and color of a Topic.

You can delete a Topic at any time if it is no longer useful. 

When you delete a Topic, it will no longer be available to the business users who used it in the Explorer.
