# How Discussion Threads Work

The discussion system is available in Zeenea Studio and Explorer from the **Datasets** object detail pages. This feature allows users to interact within discussion threads.

> **Note:** Threads are made visible to all Zeenea Studio and Explorer users and are permanent over time.

From this section, any logged-in user can:

* Create a new thread
* Reply to a thread already created by another user
* Edit one of their own messages already submitted by clicking on the "pen" icon in the top right-hand corner.
